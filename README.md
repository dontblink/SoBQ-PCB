# SoBQ-PCB
SPHINX OF BLACK QUARTZ, JUDGE MY VOW

## Layout:
Took some cues from the typical 75% layout, but shifted over the column row so that compatability with standard keysets is ~mostly good~ eh, could be worse. 
There still might be issues with the right hand bottom row layout, used 1u there :(
